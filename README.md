# Description
This is a strategy game created by Prince Game Group for class project. It uses Java and JavaFX to run. In this game, the players will be ruling their kingdoms as being the 'princes.' The game will make the players to choose variety of options; it may have both good and bad effects to the players stats. The main objective of this game is to choose the options wisely and being a good prince, and live as long as possible. 

There are three types of foce factors, clergy, nobility, and commoners. The options made by the players will affect these three's influence and loyalty scales. If either one of the force's influence reaches to 100 or the loyalty reaches to 0, the game will be over at that point. Besides these, the players themselves also have three stats, wealth, health, and army. If one of them becomes 0, the game will be over as well. In other words, the players need to sustain their stats values in the range and keep good relationships with the other factors, of course, don't forget caring themselves too.
